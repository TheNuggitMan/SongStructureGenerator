Song Structure Generator
========================

Introduction
------------
This is a project suggested by Codecademy. The brief is to create a mixed message generator where when the user clicks a button, they are presented with a new random message each time. That, or, I can switch it up and add my own twist to the same type of project. Which I have. [Deeper Explanation](#Deeper-Explanation-and-uses)

Task-List
---------
-[x] Create the basic functionality of button press gets random elements
-[x] Order the output elements (if generated)
-[ ] Add user input to set how many instances of an element are generated
-[ ] Add user input to constrain(or maybe set?) the amount of elements generated

Languages
---------
This will be built for a browser using HTML5, CSS3 and JS. 


Deeper Explanation and uses
----------------------------
I have decided to turn it into a song structure generator, where at a button press you will be presented with a minimum of 3 song structure elements, for example; Verse, Chorus, Outro. **or** verse(3), chorus(2), bridge. **or** intro, Chorus(4), Outro. 

Minimum of 3 but max of 5, which I hope to add as a feature for the user to decide. To further that feature, the user will be able to constrain the amount of instances of each structure element, to say, only have 3 verses and 1 chorus **IF** either of those elements are generated. 

The point is to have a bit of fun making music, this will give the structure to try and make a song to, which if left un-constrained, could be very challenging and fun!
